\arguments{
\item{time}{vector of times (possibly censored)}

\item{status}{vector of usual survival status indicators (0 for censored observations, 1 otherwise)}

\item{group}{vector of binary group indicator. The reference group should be coded 0, the other 1.}

\item{t}{the time point of interest (e.g. 1 to compute 1-year risk ratio)}

\item{SR.H0}{the survival ratio under the null hypothesis, to compute a p-value. Default is 1.}

\item{RR.H0}{the risk ratio under the null hypothesis, to compute a p-value. Default is 1.}

\item{Diff.H0}{the risk difference under the null hypothesis, to compute a p-value. Default is 0.}

\item{level}{confidence level for the confidence intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{contr}{list of control parameters. tol=tolerance for numerical computation, default is 1e-5. method="EL", "Wald" or "both"  indicates wether 95\% CI and the p-value should be computed based on Empirical Likelihood inference, Wald-type inference or both. algo=2 is currently the only option that is implemented.}

\description{
Computes an (absolute) risk difference, risk ratio or survival ratio with right-censored data, together with a confidence intervals and
p-values (to test for difference between two groups). Pointwise estimates are computed via the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Computation of confidence intervals
and p-values are based on either Empirical Likelihood (EL) inference or Wald-type inference. Both are non-parametric approaches, which are asymptotically equivalent.
See Thomas & Grunkemeier (1975) for details about the Empirical Likelihood method. For the Wald-type approach, the asymptotic normal approximation is used on
the log scale for the risk ratio or survival ratio. No transformation is used for the risk or survival difference.
