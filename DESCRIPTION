Description: Functions to compute t-year survival probabilities and t-year
    risks with right censored survival data. The Kaplan-Meier estimator
    is used to provide estimates for data without competing risks and
    the Aalen-Johansen estimator is used when there are competing risks.
    Confidence intervals and p-values are obtained using either usual
    Wald-type inference or empirical likelihood inference, as described
    in Thomas and Grunkemeier (1975) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1975.10480315>,
    Blanche (2020) <doi:10.1007/s10985-018-09458-6> or
    Blanche and Eriksson (2023). Functions for both one-sample and
    two-sample inference are provided. Unlike Wald-type inference,
    empirical likelihood inference always leads to consistent conclusions,
    in terms of statistical significance, when comparing two risks
    (or survival probabilities) via either a ratio or a difference.
